WHat is Object Oriented Programming(OOP):
	OOP is just a way of writing code. There are other ways as well like
	functional programming.
Why we should learn about OOP?
	1)It helps us maintain and modify the code easily.
	2)It helps us write more secure code.
	3) Simplify the development of large programs.
	4)It helps us reduce duplicate code in our programs.

Main pillars of OOP
	1)Classes and objects.
	2)Inheritance.
	3)Polymorphism.
	4)Abstraction.
	5)Encapsulation.
Classes and Objects?
	A class is a template/Blueprint from which we create the objects.
	An Object in programming is very similar to the objects that we have in real life.
Object:
	Objects have states that defines how the object looks like. we define the states with the help
	of Attributes/properties/fields inside a class.
	Objects can also have behaviours(Things that object can do). We use methods to define these
	behaviours.


String class:
	String is the most widely used class in java. It helps us store and
	manipulate Text based data.
Why we should learn about String class and its methods:
	String class has a lot of methods that can help us manipulate the text based data.
	That why we don't need to write any logic we can simple create the object of the String
	class and can use the method from that class.
Syntax:
	String str=new String("I can't sleep if i don't solve Repls");
	String str2="I can't sleep if i don't solve Repls";
	str2.length();
